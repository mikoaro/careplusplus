# CarePlusPlus - Generative AI Super App and Toolbox for Healthcare


CarePlusPlus is a people-centered healthcare SuperApp toolbox for health literacy and education and promoting relationship between physical health, nutrition and mental well-being for optimal overall health.

We are currently starting with two apps in CarePlusPlus SuperApp, namely CarePlus and Moodl apps.

With CarePlus, people will be able to easily access health information provided by organizations.

With Moodl, track your mood and stress level manually and automatically using wearables, IoT with AI analytics, discover mood and stress relief activity recommendations, including connecting with experts or therapists in the field

By using **OpenAI SDK**, **vector embeddings**, **Pinecone**, and **Postgres**, the chatbot knows about nutrition and dry eye information documents stored on the Amazon S3 object storage with the vector embeddings stored in Pinecone. It can retrieve relevant information to answer your questions and summarize information.

**Response streaming** is implemented via the **Vercel AI SDK**.
